/**
 `WonderPush` is your main interface to the WonderPush SDK.

 Make sure you properly installed the WonderPush SDK, as described in [the guide](../index.html).

 You must call `<setClientId:secret:>` before using any other method.

 Troubleshooting tip: As the SDK should not interfere with your application other than when a notification is to be shown, make sure to monitor your logs for WonderPush output during development, if things did not went as smoothly as they should have.
